# JSON Formatter Chrome Extension

When loaded page is detected to be valid JSON (Begins with either '[' or '{' and can be JSON.parse-d), this extension re-writes the page as a rich HTML JSON navigator in a similar style to MacOS Finder.

### Inspired by [JSON Finder](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/json-finder/flhdcaebggmmpnnaljiajhihdfconkbj)
